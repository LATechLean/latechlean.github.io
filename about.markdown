This course provides a hands-on introduction to formal verification and computer-assisted proof development using the Lean theorem prover. 
You will learn how to represent mathematical concepts in a precise formal language, construct and verify proofs interactively, and leverage automated techniques to eliminate logical errors. 
Along the way, youâ€™ll explore core ideas from logic, type theory, and proof strategies that can be applied to create robust formalizations of everything from classical theorems to complex software specifications.
